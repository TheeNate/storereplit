Convert single design page from direct checkout to cart-only workflow
The single design page currently has a direct checkout flow that bypasses the cart. Change it to use the cart system exclusively for consistency.
Current Single Design Page Issues:

Circular radio buttons for size selection
Direct checkout form appears below when size selected
Bypasses the cart system entirely
Inconsistent with cart-based checkout flow

Required Changes:
1. Replace Size Selection Interface:
Current: 4 boxes with prices and circular radio button selectors
New: 4 boxes with prices and "ADD TO CART" buttons
Each size box should have:

Size name and description (keep existing)
Price display (keep existing)
"ADD TO CART" button instead of circular selector
Button shows cart icon + "ADD TO CART" text

2. Remove Entire Checkout Section:
Delete completely:

Customer information form
Address fields
Payment method selection (Stripe/Bitcoin)
Payment processing components
All checkout-related state management

3. Add Simple Cart Navigation:
Replace checkout section with:

"PROCEED TO CHECKOUT" button (only shows if cart has items)
Button links to /cart page
Shows current cart item count
Matches cyberpunk/matrix design theme

4. Add to Cart Functionality:
When "ADD TO CART" button clicked:

Add item to cart state (designId + sizeId)
Show success notification: "Added to cart!"
Update cart badge in header
Keep user on design page (don't navigate away)

5. Updated User Flow:

Browse design page
Click "ADD TO CART" on desired size
Item added to cart with confirmation
Click "PROCEED TO CHECKOUT" to go to cart
Complete order through existing cart checkout flow

6. Design Requirements:

"ADD TO CART" buttons match existing button styling
Use shopping cart icon from Lucide React
Maintain existing hover effects and animations
Keep size box selection visual feedback (highlight when hovering)

Files to Update:

design-detail.tsx - Remove checkout flow, add cart buttons
Cart state management - Ensure single design additions work
Remove single design payment processing routes if they exist

Result: Clean product browsing page that feeds into the perfect cart system you already have. All orders go through cart for consistency.
