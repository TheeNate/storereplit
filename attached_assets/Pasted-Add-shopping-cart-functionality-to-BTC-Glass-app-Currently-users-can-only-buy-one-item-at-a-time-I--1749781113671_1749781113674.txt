Add shopping cart functionality to BTC Glass app
Currently users can only buy one item at a time. I need to add "Add to Cart" functionality so customers can purchase multiple glass art pieces in one order.
Current State:

Cart icon exists in header but shows "Your cart is empty"
Design detail pages only have direct "Pay Now" buttons
No way to add items to cart
No cart management functionality

Required Changes:
1. Add "Add to Cart" button to design-detail.tsx:

Replace or add alongside current payment flow
Button should say "ADD TO CART" with shopping cart icon
After clicking, show confirmation (item added to cart)
Update cart icon badge with item count

2. Cart state management:

Store cart items in browser state (useState/localStorage equivalent)
Each cart item needs: designId, sizeId, quantity, customerInfo
Cart should persist between page visits
Show total item count in header cart badge

3. Update cart page functionality:

Show list of items in cart with images and details
Allow quantity changes (+ / - buttons)
Allow item removal from cart
Show individual prices and total price
"Proceed to Checkout" button

4. Multi-item checkout process:

Cart checkout should support both Stripe and Bitcoin payments
Calculate total amount for all items
Create single payment for entire cart
After payment, create individual order records for each item
Send single confirmation email with all items listed

5. UI Requirements:

Keep existing cyberpunk/matrix design aesthetic
Cart badge on header icon showing item count
Cart items should show design image, title, size, and price
Mobile-responsive cart page
Loading states for add to cart actions

Key Technical Points:

Don't change existing single-item purchase flow (keep it as backup)
Cart data structure should be compatible with existing order system
Use existing Stripe and Zaprite payment integrations
Keep all existing database schemas and email functionality
Multi-item orders should create separate order records per item (not combined orders)

Database Considerations:

No database changes needed
Create individual order records for each cart item after payment
Each order record should have same structure as current single-item orders

Focus ONLY on adding cart functionality. Don't modify Bitcoin payments, Stripe integration, admin panel, or any other existing features.
