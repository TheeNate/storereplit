I've successfully tested the Zaprite API and confirmed the working endpoint. Here's what I need you to implement:
Zaprite API Details (CONFIRMED WORKING):

Endpoint: https://api.zaprite.com/v1/order (singular "order")
Method: POST
Auth: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Response includes: checkoutUrl field for customer payment

Required Environment Variables:
ZAPRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret_here
Implementation Requirements:

Add payment method selector in design-detail.tsx:

Show choice between Stripe (credit card) and Bitcoin
Only show customer form after payment method selected
Update payment button text based on method


Create Zaprite API route (/api/zaprite/create-order):

Use endpoint: https://api.zaprite.com/v1/order
Send: amount, currency, description, customer_email, metadata
Return: checkoutUrl from response


Update design-detail payment flow:

When Bitcoin selected: call Zaprite API instead of Stripe
Redirect customer to checkoutUrl for Bitcoin payment
Keep existing Stripe flow unchanged


Add Zaprite webhook handler (/api/webhooks/zaprite):

Handle incoming payment notifications from Zaprite
Update order status in database
Send confirmation emails (same as Stripe flow)
Use existing order processing logic


Key Integration Points:

Zaprite orders should create same database records as Stripe orders
Use same email notification system
Same admin panel should show both payment types
Keep all existing Stripe functionality working



UI Requirements:

Payment method selector with Bitcoin/credit card options
Bitcoin payment button redirects to Zaprite checkout
Match existing cyberpunk/matrix aesthetic
Show Bitcoin amounts in BTC and USD

Database:

Add payment_method field to orders table ("stripe" or "bitcoin")
Add zaprite_order_id field to track Zaprite order IDs
Keep all existing order fields and relationships

The app already has complete Stripe integration with order management, email notifications, and admin panel. Add Bitcoin as a second payment option without breaking existing functionality.
